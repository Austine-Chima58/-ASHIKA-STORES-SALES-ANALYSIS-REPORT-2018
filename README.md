RECOMMENDATIONS: 
    Base on the findings and analysis from the visualization. I humbly recommend the following in order to improve the online sales of the business

1) The clothing category should be allocated with more capital alor resources followed by the category of Electronics
2) Market Strategy Should be employed in the month of March so as to increase more sales and other months of the year should be highly placed with more effect on the strategy too 
3) Cash On Delivery should be enhanced since most of the customers prefer it's use such as improving the customer services 
4) Efficiency of supply of goods to the State of Maharashtra should be increased as to maximize profits
5) Discount should be made available to Priyanka for his constant patronage and also subsequent customers how engages regularly so as to motivate
